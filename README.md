# Fake News Detection Project

This project dives into the important area of media integrity. It uses Machine Learning techniques to identify and classify fake news articles, helping to promote a more informed public discourse.

## Overview

In an age of rapid information spread, distinguishing credible news from misinformation is a significant challenge. This project aims to address this by building a system that can automatically detect fake news. It likely involves collecting and processing news data, training machine learning models, and potentially deploying an application to make predictions on new articles.

## Key Features (General Outline)

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gathering news articles from various sources and preparing them for model training (e.g., text cleaning, feature extraction).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing and training different classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, LSTM, BERT - specific models would be detailed in the project's documentation or code) to distinguish between real and fake news.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using various metrics.
- **Prediction/Demonstration App:** Likely a web application (possibly using Streamlit, given the `.streamlit` folder) where users can input news text or a URL to get a prediction on its authenticity.

## Directory Structure

- `apps/`: Contains the source code for the application (e.g., Streamlit app).
- `data/`: Stores the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: Contains saved machine learning models or scripts for model building.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, data exploration, and model development.
- `assets/`: Likely stores static files like images or other resources used by the project or documentation.
- `.streamlit/`: Configuration files for the Streamlit application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running, you'll typically need to:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    (If you're reading this, you've likely already done this!)

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    # On macOS/Linux use `source venv/bin/activate`
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application/scripts:**
    _(Please add specific instructions here on how to run your main application or any key scripts. For example, if it's a Streamlit app: `streamlit run apps/your_app_script.py`)_
